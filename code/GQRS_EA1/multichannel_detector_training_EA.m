% The multi-channel QRS complex detector simultaneously monitors N

% is signaled in a given ECG channel, a time window TD is opened during

% simultaneous and over which the final decision rule is applied. Window TD
% was chosen to be 150 ms long (TD = matchWindow) to tackle with the
% different QRS complex morphologies and different latencies of the cardiac
% electric phenomena, as consequence of the spatial variation of electrode
% placement, that could produce individual decisions shifted in time.
