Article code Optimization of Multi-channel Detection of the QRS Complex in ECG Recordings using Evolutionary Algorithms

##Abstract
Detecting the QRS complex is the most fundamental task in automatically processing and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. However, the combination of the redundant information available from different sources has not been fully exploited to improve the detection of this typical ECG waveform. Therefore, in this work, we are interested in improving the detection performance of QRS complexes on multi-channel ECG recordings using evolutionary algorithms (EA). Specifically, we optimally combined single-channel QRS complex detections into a single detection signal by minimizing the detection error rate as a cost function. QRS detection performances of three commonly used detectors on the twelve ECG channel INCART database show increases of up to 0.44\% in sensitivity and up to 0.25\% in positive predictivity and a reduction of up to 0.85\% in the detection error rate compared with their single-channel detector counterparts.
